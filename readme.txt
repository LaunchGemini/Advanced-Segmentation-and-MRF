Welcome to the OpenCV-based project, originally articulated by LaunchGemini. It comprises the generation of segmentation using depth maps and image denoising utilizing Markov Random Field (MRF) following the Fusion4D methodology. Get further information on Fusion4D here: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301654702_Fusion4D_Real-time_Performance_Capture_of_Challenging_Scenes. The aim is to provide a simple, comprehensive package that encapsulates complex Image Processing tasks using OpenCV along with depth map-based segmentation and MRF-
